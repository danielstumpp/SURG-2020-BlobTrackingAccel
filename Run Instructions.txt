Parameter Descriptions:
Input File = Path to event stream text file; events should be in x y t p format
Filter Threshold = Minimum event activity required in a cell to be considered for tracking algorithm
# of Blobs = Number of trackers to instantiate (-1 -> unlimited)
Blob Activation Threshold = Number of events required for a tracker to be considered active
Starting Blob Size = initial sigmaX/sigmaY values for deterimining size of tracker axes
Shape Update = weighted update used to adjust tracker shape over time
Position Update = weighted update used to adjust tracker position over time
Smoothing Factor = double exponential smoothing weight used to smooth tracker positions over time
Integration Time = time in milliseconds to consider as a single frame output
